# HTML in Ruby with blocks

The `html` gem lets you define HMTL documents using Ruby blocks. A short discription how to use this package is included in the [RDoc documentation](https://sebfisch.github.io/html-rb/HTML.html).

The `html` gem is not yet published to [RubyGems.org](http://rubygems.org/). You can download [html-0.1.1.gem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebfisch/html-rb/master/html-0.1.1.gem) and install it as follows:

    gem install html-0.1.1.gem

You can use the latest version of the `html` gem in a project by including this line in your `Gemfile`:

    gem "html", :git => "git://github.com/sebfisch/html-rb.git"
